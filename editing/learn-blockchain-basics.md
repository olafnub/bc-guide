# Blockchain Basics

### Introduction

Blockchain is the foundational technology behind Web3. In this lesson, we'll explore what blockchain is, how it works, and why it's revolutionary. We'll break down complex concepts into digestible pieces and provide practical examples to help you understand this transformative technology.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What is a blockchain?
- How does blockchain work?
- Key components of blockchain technology
- Types of blockchains
- Real-world blockchain applications

### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the data cannot be altered retroactively. Think of it as a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions.

Key characteristics:
- Decentralized: No single entity controls the network
- Immutable: Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed
- Transparent: All transactions are visible to network participants
- Secure: Uses cryptography to ensure data integrity

### How Does Blockchain Work?

1. **Transaction Creation**
   - Users initiate transactions
   - Transactions are broadcast to the network
   - Transactions are verified by network participants

2. **Block Formation**
   - Valid transactions are grouped into blocks
   - Each block contains a reference to the previous block
   - Blocks are added to the chain in chronological order

3. **Consensus Mechanisms**
   - Proof of Work (PoW)
   - Proof of Stake (PoS)
   - Other consensus algorithms

### Types of Blockchains

1. **Public Blockchains**
   - Open to everyone
   - Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum
   - Fully decentralized

2. **Private Blockchains**
   - Restricted access
   - Used by organizations
   - More centralized control

3. **Consortium Blockchains**
   - Controlled by a group of organizations
   - Hybrid approach
   - Common in enterprise solutions

### Real-World Applications

- Cryptocurrencies
- Supply chain management
- Digital identity
- Voting systems
- Smart contracts
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
