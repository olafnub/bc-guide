A blog section dedicated for community posts; you can post blogs on here! More info below, Excited to see you here :)

<!-- truncate -->

The idea of blog posts are for shorter or longer content forms where people can visit and look at. Information such as resume tips, web3 ideas, and understanding of how crypto tech works are posts we hope to continue.

## About this Project
The internet is filled with guides and resources, and many of them are really good / a hidden gem. The problem is for anyone that wants to kick start their web3 journey will most likely not have access to those materials as their stacked upon the thousands of other guides.

Therefore, the idea of this project is to provide an online guide about web3, crypto, and the blockchain industry **with these resources**; Allowing anyone who's interested, to learn on their own pace and on their learning way, as there will be videos, articles, and hands-on exercises. Treat this as your personal web3 library.

Note: If there's any suggestions, feel free to check out the <a href="/create-a-post">"create a post"</a> tab, type up the suggestion and submit! Don't worry as it won't be uploaded to the blog section automatically -- It'll just allow me to see the feedback w/o having to create another form.
