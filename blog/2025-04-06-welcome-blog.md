<!-- truncate -->

A blog section dedicated for community posts; you can post blogs on here! More info below, Excited to see you here :)

The idea of blog posts are for shorter or longer content forms where people can visit and look at. Information such as resume tips, web3 ideas, and understanding of how crypto tech works are posts we hope to continue.

## Welcome
The internet is filled with guides and resources, many of are really good material and are sometimes a hidden gem. The problem is for people that want to get into this space, most likely will not have access to the material as most of the guides are hidden upon thousands of other guides on the internet.

So, we decided to make a compile all the best resources about web3 and make it a one-stop place for those interested in learning more about the web3, crypto, and the blockchain space! We empower those who learn best on their own pace and will provide materials such as videos, articles, and hands-on exercises to help fit the need of different learning styles. _Treat this as your personal web3 pocket book._

Note: If there's any suggestions, feel free to check out the <a href="/contribute">"Contribute"</a> tab, and send a message to me on telegram. Whether there's information that can reworded, or are unclear, readers like you will help the growth of this curriculum!
