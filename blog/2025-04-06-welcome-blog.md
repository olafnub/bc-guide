A blog section dedicated for community posts; you can post blogs on here! More info below, Excited to see you here :)

The idea of blog posts are for shorter or longer content forms where people can visit and look at. Information such as resume tips, web3 ideas, and understanding of how crypto tech works are posts we hope to continue.

## About this Project
The internet is filled with guides and resources, and many of them are really good / a hidden gem. The problem is for anyone that wants to kick start their web3 journey will most likely not have access to those materials as their stacked upon the thousands of other guides.

So, we decided to make a compile all the best resources on web3 and make it a one-stop shop for those interested in exploring web3, crypto, and the blockchain industry. Empowering those who learn best on their own pace and their way of learning as there will be videos, articles, and hands-on exercises. Treat this as your personal web3 pocket book.

Note: If there's any suggestions, feel free to check out the <a href="/contribute">"Contribute"</a> tab, and send me whatever message you'd like, whether there's information that can reworded differently, or are unclear, or wrong. Readers like you will help this project flourish!
