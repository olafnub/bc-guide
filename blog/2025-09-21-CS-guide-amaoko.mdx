### Internship resources by Amaoko
🚀 ✨ Internship & Career Resources for Students (2026 + beyond) (1st & 2nd years)

Hey everyone 👋🏿, 
I pulled together a list of early-career programs and other resources that could be helpful in your internship search this year and even to plan ahead for next year (of the application is closed). Some are open now, others are coming up soon, and the rest are good to keep in mind for the future.

I know how easy it is for opportunities like these slip by without us even knowing. I’ve been there before so I hope these resources I've gathered here makes the search a little easier and helps you stay ahead.


Below is a list organized by A, B, C, D to skim through easily. If you can only read one part, checkout D (a great trick to know) 👇🏿

A. 🎯 Early-Career Internship Programs (freshmen, sophomores, juniors) can more or often lead to return offers!

D. ⏳ LinkedIn Job Search Trick 
Filter jobs by “Past 24 hours.” Then in the URL, change r86000 → r3600 to see jobs posted within the last hour. Game-changer.


🙌🏿 I truly hope this helps you stay ahead in your internship search. If this was helpful in any way shape or form, feel free to share it with others or save it to keep in mind for next year.

💭 Also, drop any other programs/resources (even ones that already closed this year) in the comments so more students can plan for it in the future.

Let’s make the journey a little bit easier for each other 👊🏿💯
