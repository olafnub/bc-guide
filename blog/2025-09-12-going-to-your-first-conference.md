Here's everything you need to know to prepare you for your first blockchain/web3/crypto conference!

## Why people are in this field (and you should look into it too)
Majority of people that you're going to interact with at this conference originally onboarded for the money, and that's totally valid! In my opinion, that's about how 90% of the people in the industry got into crypto. They most likely learned about stocks, then index funds and etfs, and then heard people talking about three or four times before taking a deeper look. Or witnessed a meme coin do a 20x and went straight to research.

Personally I was a very long-term, index fund focused investor. I would watch Graham Stephen 3 times a week and I had poured majority of my money into VOO or VTI for my retirement. (this still is a great option btw, don't let anyone tell you otherwise) 

It was then when Graham uploaded a video on Shiba inu, and I realized people are actually making a shi#t ton of money in crypto. Obviously, I didn't jump into learning right away, and it took a few more stories for me to actually look into crypto. What finally convinced me was through a reddit post on r/FIRE. Their posts had a bunch of downvotes for saying people inthe subreddit should should look into Bitcoin if they wanted to retire early as it had promising tech and it growing a lot. I replied to their thread asking if they'd recommend any they'd resources and they mentioned MIT's Bitcoin course. 

At that time, I had already put $100 into Bitcoin because zooming out the chart, it was only going up (this was peak 2022 ~$60k) and I thought it would keep going up and that I was early. 

TLDR; Traditional investors are exploring crypto for big gains and realizing there's a whole industry behind it.
