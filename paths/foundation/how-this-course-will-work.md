# How this Course Will Work

### Introduction

The Mint Project is a free online journal focused on teaching you blockchain, web3, and crypto. Understanding the basics of blockchain is a huge plus if you ever want to work in crypto fintech, or a web3 company.

This journal has been inspired by the [CollegeDAO](https://collegedao.io/), which consists of universities and schools from all over the world, and heavily inspired by [The Odin Project community](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which is also an open source curriculum to kick start your web dev career. A bunch of schools do not offer blockchain courses therefore having this is a great way to onboard not just students but also professionals in the field already.

In this lesson, we'll learn the general structure of this journal. And in upcoming lessons we'll go over the motivation of learning web3 and then dive deeper into fundamentals.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

 - Understand how the Mint Project works
 - Understand the Foundation course

Let's get into it!

### How it Works

This journal will consist of topic writeups, reading materials, videos, and even hands on learning on how a blockchain works. Whether
you're completely new to blockchain or just someone that just wants a refresher on certain topics, this is the guide made for you. 
Note: This is completely beginner friendly.

Each unit will be structured pretty much the same: 
```python 
Introduction -> Basic Knowledge -> Conclusion -> 
Assignment -> Knowledge Check -> Additional Resources
```

The goal of this journal is **not to score you** on what you know, but instead to provide the best learning environemnt for you to grow
in the web3 space. This is why each section is structured the way it is [(inspired by TOP)](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/templates/lesson-example.md).

Try not to skip lessons unless you truly understand them already, else this should be pretty fun <span>:)</span>

FYI feel free to join the community either on discord or telegram to chat with like-minded folks.

### What's Next

In the upcoming lessons under fundamentals, we'll understand what blockchain, web3, and crypto are. This way it can help prepare you for an upcoming role, hobby project, or to get you into the web3 field. We'll go over different blockchains and learn how a blockchain is able to operate without the need of a central authority.

Atlast, once you reach the end of the fundamentals course, you will be given resources to help with job hunting, such as how to get your first gig to growing your twitter precense. (Though do not worry about this for now as learning the fundamentals is how you'll be getting your first gig, or atleast make it easier).
