# Introduction to Web3

### Introduction

Welcome to the world of Web3! This course is designed to take you from zero to understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized applications. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone looking to solidify their understanding, this course will provide you with the essential knowledge needed to navigate the Web3 space.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a big-picture understanding of what Web3 is, how we got here, and why it matters. We’ll also highlight some real-world projects that you can check out.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What is Web3 and why does it matter?
- Understanding the evolution of the web (Web1, Web2, Web3)
- Key concepts and terminology used in the field
- Finally, real-world applications and use cases

### What is Web3?

Web3 is hypothesized to be the next evolution of the internet. It allows applications (apps) and services to be built on top of a blockchain without the need of a big tech company. We'll go more into what's a blockchain soon. 

### The Evolution of the Web (the internet)

| Era  | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|-------- |
| **Web1 (1990s–early 2000s)** | It started with web1, where they were read-only websites aka static html pages. You would browse the internet, maybe print something, and then move on. | [image example](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/269b3ad0a0aa72c233a0f3680a829e6c.jpg)
| **Web2 (2000s–now)** | Web2 came along and it introduced the idea of a more social internet. Where now people are able to interact and post their own content. | Social media, user-generated content, big platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Reddit. Apps became interactive but also centralized (meaning 1 company at top controlled all). 
| **Web3 (emerging)** | Web3, which is hypothesized to be the next stage of the internet, allows users to build applications on decentralized networks, aka a blockchain. | Focuses on decentralization, privacy, and digital ownership. Think apps *without* a central company running the show.


This is essentially birdseye view of the evolution of the internet! We'll go deeper into certain topics later in the writing & course. Let's break down the evolution of the internet in a more aestethic way.

Note: Web3 is usually paired with terminologies/topics such as blockchain, crypto, and Bitcoin. (Web3 is the umbrella for it all!)

### Problems within each Web era

- **Web1** was great but it had limited functionality, since majority were read-only websites.
- **Web2** is great since it allows us to connect with everyoen around the world, but centralized authorities are taking it too far with privacy breaches.
- **Web3** hopefully can solve the privacy problem web2 has while still allowing us to connect with each other. It isn't great as of now, but it's a field people will continue to work on. 

Another Note: Web3 isn't only for privacy focused applications, the main use case of it right now is finance. A lot of the crypto models include 

### Common Web3 Terms that’ll pop up a lot

- **Blockchain:** The core definition of a blockchain is that it's a distributed digital ledger;
Let's break this down by the definition of each word. 

Distributed: When describing an object with "distributed", it means that the object is dispersed and does not have one central location. For example, All the trees in this world are distributed since trees are dispersed around this world, not all trees are in one exact location. 

Ledger: A tracker of all financial transactions that has happened. For example, every buy and sell that's happened at your local gas station probably has a ledger that records and gets updated everytime a customer pays for gas or snacks. So a digital ledger = all financial transactions but online.

Example: Think of _blockchain_ as a Google Sheet that records buys, sells, and transfers on all transactions that's happening, i.e everyone in the world that's using the blockchain. If implemented correclty, any transaction that's happened in the past is verifiable by just looking at the google sheet (blockchain) and looking up the transaction number. This allows the proof of a transaction happening instead of trusting by word.

Blockchain usually try to follow 3 criterias: Immutable, Decentralized, and Scalable. We'll go into this more later.

- **Smart Contract:** Code that runs on the blockchain: you can deploy code onto the blockchain and have it execute based on certain conditions. Ex: The moment Moira sends Joseph x amount of money, Joseph's smart contract would execute the swap of xyz that Moira wanted. There's a saying in Web3 that "Code is Law". Since the code will only run when xyz fulfills.

- **Decentralized Application:** Also known as a dApp, it's just an app that's built on the blockchain.

- **Token:** A digital asset. Could represent money (cryptocurrency), art (NFT), identity, etc.

- **Wallet:** A digital wallet that allows you to access dApps, sign transactions, and hold tokens, buy & sell crypto.

As of right now, don't worry if you struggle on understanding what any of these terms means, and you don't need to memorize them. These terms are just words and overtime you'll get more familiar as you dive deeper into web3.

### Blockchain Risk

Web3 gives power back to users. Here’s what that looks like:

And the reason is because blockchains are also unchangable in the sense of once you post a transaction on the blockchain, it's basically impossible to undo. The cases of undoing a transaction is technically do-able but it would cost a bunch of money and resource in order to attack for x amount of time, until the system is back up again.
Risks: It's a bit costly for bad actors who want to tamper with the blockchain by submitting either fake transactions or manipulating past transactions. 

- **You own your data.** Not Meta.
- **You control your identity.** No need to log in with Google.
- **You can earn directly.** No middleman (like YouTube taking 45% of your ad revenue).
- **You can trust the system.** Because it's built on transparent code.

That’s the dream. And while Web3 isn’t perfect yet, it’s evolving fast.
