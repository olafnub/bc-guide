# Introduction to Web3

### Introduction

Welcome to the world of Web3! This course is designed to take you from zero to understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and decentralization. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone looking to solidify their understanding, this course will provide you with the essential knowledge needed to navigate the Web3 space.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a big-picture understanding of what Web3 is, how it became to be, and the underlying terms used that describes Web3. Laslty, we'll highlight common risks that you should be aware of in this space.

### Lesson Overview

- What is Web3 and why does it matter?
- The evolution of the web and internet (Web1, Web2, Web3)
- Key concepts used in the field, and Web3 risks

Let's begin!

### What is Web3?

Web3 is hypothesized to be the next evolution of the internet. We had Web 1.0 back in the 1990s, Web 2.0 since the 2000s, and now we have Web3 (atleast that's the goal of this new field). Web3 introduces the idea of a self soverign internet. What comes with this is stricter privacy protection for users, money transactions online that are much cheaper and quicker, a more trustable internet, and a lot more ideas that we'll later mention in this course.

### The Evolution of the Web (the internet)

| Era  | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|-------- |
| **Web1 (1990s–early 2000s)** | It started with web1, where they were read-only websites aka static html pages. You would browse the internet, maybe print something, and then move on. | [image example](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/269b3ad0a0aa72c233a0f3680a829e6c.jpg)
| **Web2 (2000s–now)** | Web2 came along and it introduced the idea of a more social internet. Where now people are able to interact and post their own content. | Social media, user-generated content, big platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Reddit. Apps became interactive but also centralized (meaning 1 company at top controlled all). 
| **Web3 (emerging)** | Web3, which is hypothesized to be the next stage of the internet, allows users to build applications on decentralized networks, aka a blockchain. | Focuses on decentralization, privacy, and digital ownership. Think apps *without* a central company running the show.

This is essentially birdseye view of the evolution of the internet, We'll go deeper into certain topics later in the course. _Fun Fact: The term Web3 was actually first introduced ~6 years after the launch of Bitcoin by Gavin Wood, [founder of Polkadot and co-founder of Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3#:~:text=The%20term%20%22web3%22%20was%20coined%20by%20Polkadot%20founder%20and%20Ethereum,idea%20of%20web3%20gained%20popularity)._

Note: Cryptocurrency, blockchain, NFTs, etc, are all in the web3 umbrella!

### Problems within each Web era

- **Web1** Limited functionality, since majority were read-only websites.
- **Web2** Even though it connects a mjority of pepole around the world, it has centralized companies (Meta, Amazon, Google) take it too far with privacy breaches on their users.
- **Web3** It's a new field so it's hard to adopt to. It also has a lot of scams since the very nature of web3 is self sovereignty, meaning individual users are easier to target.

### Terms that are used in Web3

- **Blockchain:** The core definition of a blockchain is that it's a digital, distributed ledger;
Let's break this down by the definition of each word. 

Digital: Online, on the internet.

Distributed: When describing an object with "distributed", it means that the object is dispersed and does not have one central location. For example, All the trees in this world are distributed since trees are dispersed around this world, not all trees are in one exact location. 

Ledger: A tracker of all financial transactions that has happened. For example, every buy and sell that's happened at your local gas station probably has a ledger that records and gets updated everytime a customer pays for gas or snacks. So a digital ledger = all financial transactions but online.

Bringing it all together: Think of _blockchain_ as a Google Sheet that records buys, sells, and transfers on all transactions that's happening, i.e everyone in the world that's using the blockchain. If implemented correclty, any transaction that's happened in the past is verifiable by just looking at the google sheet (blockchain) and looking up the transaction number. This allows the proof of a transaction happening instead of trusting by word.

- **Smart Contract:** Code that runs on the blockchain: you can deploy code onto the blockchain and have it execute based on certain conditions. Ex: When Moira sends Joseph $10 on the blockchain, Joseph's smart contract would execute the swap of the product that Moira paid for. The code in Joseph's smart contract is unchangeable because it's on the blockchain. There's a saying in Web3 that "Code is Law".

- **Decentralized vs Centralized**: Centralize means there's a central entity that controls everything. Ex: Amazon controls all the products that it owns. Decentralized means that there's no central entity that controls everything. Ex: Bitcoin is decentralized since no one controls the entire blockchain.

- **Decentralized Application:** Also known as a dApp, it's just an app that's built on the blockchain.

- **Token:** A digital asset. Could represent money (cryptocurrency), art (NFT), identity, etc. Most of the time when people say tokens, they're usually talking about some cryptocurrency. But a token can really be any digital assets on the blockchain, such as an NFT (Non-Fungible-Token).

- **Wallet:** A digital wallet that allows you to access dApps, sign transactions, and hold tokens, buy & sell crypto.

As of right now, don't worry on understanding or memorizing what any of these terms mean. Overtime you'll get more familiar with them as you dive deeper into web3 and see them more often.

### Web3 Risks

While Web3 introduces a lot of good ideas, such as allowing users to take control of their finances, privacy, and data _without_ the need of an external party, users in web3 unfortunately suffer a lot more risk on scams. 1 because it's such a new field, and we're all boomers when using it, and 2 because of the nature of web3 being decentralized. Since there's no central authority, such as a bank that may have a lot more cyber defense, you being an individual holding 10s of thousands of dollars are more prone to clicking one wrong button and losing your entire net worth. You also an individual can be an easier to target instead of the hacker going after an entire bank.

### Common Risks to look out for

Scams are always evolving and as this field continues to grow therefore more and more scams will pop up overtime. Note that mentioning this isn't to scare you, but to let you know what's out there in order to prevent such an attack. Here are a few examples to be on the lookout for.

<div class="lesson-content__conclusion" markdown="1"> 
<!-- To make the link green -->
- Verify that links are what they actually are, for example [www.yahoo.com](https://www.google.com/) may seem like it directs you to yahoo but if you hover over the link and check the bottom left of your screen, it will show it's directed to google instead.

- When you receive an email or dm from someone, look at the time. If an important email was sent at 3am, this may be a red flag so make sure it's legit before proceeding on their ask.

- If on telegram, people will impersonate your friends telegram. **NEVER** send money if asked through telegram or click on a link without verifying that the person is real, even if it's a friend or client. Bots will copy your friends telegram's profile picture, name, and description when they reach out to you. Double check that you share the same groups or have the same message history before continuing.

In the future, we can publish more on what to lookout for in the blog section, feel free to send us some of the precautions [that you know of](/contribute)!

<!-- And the reason is because blockchains are also unchangable in the sense of once you post a transaction on the blockchain, it's basically impossible to undo. The cases of undoing a transaction is technically do-able but it would cost a bunch of money and resource in order to attack for x amount of time, until the system is back up again.
Risks: It's a bit costly for bad actors who want to tamper with the blockchain by submitting either fake transactions or manipulating past transactions.  -->

<!-- - **You own your data.** Not Meta.
- **You control your identity.** No need to log in with Google.
- **You can earn directly.** No middleman (like YouTube taking 45% of your ad revenue).
- **You can trust the system.** Because it's built on transparent code. -->

<!-- That’s the dream. And while Web3 isn’t perfect yet, it’s evolving fast. -->
