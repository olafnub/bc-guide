# What are Web3/Crypto Wallets?

### Introduction

Crypto wallets are basically your **account** on the blockchain. Just like PayPal lets you send and receive money online, crypto wallets let you send and receive cryptocurrencies — with some extra ✨crypto magic✨ behind the scenes.

Instead of a username or account number, you’re given a **wallet address** that looks like this:
```
0x6914fc70fac4cab20a8922e900c4ba57feecf8e1
```
This is your **public key** — kind of like your email address for receiving funds. But make no mistake: your **private key** or **seed phrase** is 🔐 top secret. Anyone with your private key can control your wallet and steal your funds. Never share it, ever.

Even though every transaction from and to your wallet is visible on the blockchain, no one knows who actually owns the wallet. It’s anonymous by default. That said…

### Crypto Care 🛡️

Crypto wallets are anonymous, but don’t get too excited. Authorities can trace funds once they’re converted to fiat currencies like USD. If your crypto wallet is tied to any shady business, you might get a knock on the door 🕵️

### Wallet Types

There are several types of wallets, and each has its own use case, pros, and cons. Let’s break them down 👇

#### Hot Wallets 🔥
Hot wallets store your private key on a device connected to the internet. This makes them super convenient for day-to-day use, but they’re also more exposed to hacks. Most hot wallets are free and beginner-friendly.

**Examples:**
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Edge Wallet
- Rabby Wallet
- Trust Wallet

> 🔜 In the next lesson, we’ll walk you through how to set up MetaMask step-by-step.

#### Cold Wallets ❄️
Cold wallets keep your private keys offline. Most are physical devices like USB drives (Ledger, Trezor), or even pieces of paper with printed keys (yes, really).

They’re more secure — but also less convenient.
- Slower to access
- Usually not free
- Ideal for long-term or large holdings

**Examples:**
- Ledger Nano X
- Trezor Model T

#### Multisig Wallets 🧩
Multisignature wallets require approval from **multiple wallets** before any transaction can happen. Think of them as team-controlled wallets used by:
- Investment funds
- DAOs
- Startups managing shared treasury

**Example setup:** 3 out of 5 signers must approve a transaction before it can be executed.

**Examples:**
- Gnosis Safe
- Electrum
- Instadapp

### Setting Up MetaMask

MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets for a reason:
- It’s browser-based
- Beginner-friendly
- Great documentation & support

> We’ll guide you through MetaMask setup in the next lesson.

### Security Tips 🔒

Before you dive into DeFi and web3 apps, here are some **must-know** safety tips:

#### Seed Phrase = Master Key
- A 12-word phrase shown to you *once* during wallet setup
- Write it down. Store it offline.
- Do not screenshot. Do not copy-paste. Just… no.

#### Private Keys
- Never share them — ever
- Anyone with your private key has full access to your wallet

#### Connect Carefully
- Only connect your wallet to **trusted websites**
- Don’t sign suspicious messages or transactions

Stay safe out there, anon 🕶️
