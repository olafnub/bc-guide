# How this Course Will Work

### Introduction

BrainEater.io is an online curriculum focused on teaching you blockchain, web3, and crypto. Being able to understand the fundamentals of blockchain is a great way to get started working in the crypto industry, whether it's a web3 fintech company, a web3 agency, or a web3 law firm, this is the right place for you.

Before we begin, I want to note that this guide has been heavily inspired by the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), it is an open source curriculum that helps kick start your web dev career (and it's how I got started in web dev). Another shoutout is to [CollegeDAO](https://collegedao.io/) as it inspired the creation of this curriculum. Many schools around the globe do not offer blockchain courses or have a blockchain community, therefore CollegeDao's mission is to gather [university blockchain clubs](https://collegedao.io/ecosystem) from all over the world and connect them with each other + industry leaders for guest speakers, sharing job opportunities, helping set up node validators, etc. **Thank you to all that's reading this, and I hope you enjoy this guide!**

Here are a couple of terms used throughout this website, and we'll use the website url as an example:

- Curriculum = the entirity of this website/guide, ex: **BrainEater.io** is the curriculum
- Course = the paths taken, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/**foundation** is the course.
- Lesson = the single pages in each course, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/foundation/**how-this-course-will-work** is the lesson.

In this lesson, we'll learn the general structure of this curriculum. And in upcoming lessons we'll go over the motivation of learning web3 and then dive deeper into fundamentals.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

 - Understand how this curriculum works
 - Understand the Foundation course

Let's get into it!

### How it Works

This curriculum will consist of topic writeups, reading materials, videos, and even hands on learning on how a blockchain works. Whether
you're completely new to blockchain or just someone that just wants a refresher on certain topics, this is the guide made for you. 
Note: This is completely beginner friendly.

Each lesson will be structured pretty much the same: 
```python 
Introduction -> Basic Knowledge -> Conclusion -> 
Assignment -> Knowledge Check -> Additional Resources
```

The goal of this journal is **not to score you** on what you know, but instead to provide the best learning environemnt for you to grow
in the web3 space. This is why each section is structured the way it is [(inspired by TOP)](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/templates/lesson-example.md).

Try not to skip lessons unless you truly understand them already, else this should be pretty fun <span>:)</span>

FYI feel free to join the community either on discord or telegram to chat with like-minded folks.

### What's Next

In the upcoming lessons under fundamentals, we'll understand what blockchain, web3, and crypto are. This way it can help prepare you for an upcoming role, hobby project, or to get you into the web3 field. We'll go over different blockchains and learn how a blockchain is able to operate without the need of a central authority.

Atlast, once you reach the end of the fundamentals course, you will be given resources to help with job hunting, such as how to get your first gig to growing your twitter precense. (Though do not worry about this for now as learning the fundamentals is how you'll be getting your first gig, or atleast make it easier).
