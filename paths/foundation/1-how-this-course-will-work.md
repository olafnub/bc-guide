# How this Course Will Work

### Introduction

BrainEater.io is an online curriculum focused on teaching you blockchain, web3, and crypto. Being able to understand the fundamentals of blockchain is a great way to get started working in the crypto industry, whether you're trying to join / in the process of joining a web3 company, this is the right place for you.

Before we begin, I want to note that this guide has been heavily inspired by the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), TOP is an open source curriculum that helps guide people on their web dev career (and it's actually how I started my web dev journey). Everything is free and it'll guide you A-Z on the fundamentals of web dev such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github, and Git + more. 

Another shoutout is to [CollegeDAO](https://collegedao.io/), it's a student led organization that started at the University of Michigan and has expanded to over 150+ schools around the globe. Many blockchain clubs such as Berkeley blockchain, Vanderbilt, UPenn, KU, Purdue, Dalhousie, Columbia... the list goes on that are in partnership with CollegeDao. Their mission is to gather [university blockchain clubs](https://collegedao.io/ecosystem) from all over the world, connect them with each other & allow clubs to participate in the ecosystem: providing guest speakers, validators, governance, job opportunities, and etc. **And lastly, thank you to everyone that is reading this, wishing you the best, and I hope you enjoy this guide!**

Here are a couple of terms used throughout this website that we should know, using the website url as an example:

- Curriculum = the entirity of this website/guide, ex: **BrainEater.io** is the curriculum
- Course = the path taken, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/**foundation** is the course.
- Lesson = the single pages in each course, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/foundation/**how-this-course-will-work** is the lesson.

For the lesson today, we'll learn the general structure of this curriculum and a couple of pointers to know about. And in the upcoming lessons we'll go over what web3 is, motivation of learning web3, and other guides to help prepare you for this journey.

### Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of the topics that you will learn in this lesson.

 - Understand how this curriculum works
 - Understand the foundation course

Let's get into it!

### How it Works

Each lesson under this curriculum will consist of general writeup on the topic, reading materials and videos, and sometimes hands on learning to get a better grasp on how something works. The goal is to prepare you with the basic knowledge of the whatever topic that you're on and so when you do work on the assigments, you'll have a better understanding on what the material is trying to teach Again, whether you're completely new to blockchain or just someone that just wants a refresher on certain topics, this is guide is made for you as we'll take in account on different learning methods. _Beginner friendly_

Every lesson will be structured pretty much the same: 
```python 
Introduction -> Basic Knowledge -> Conclusion -> 
Assignment -> Knowledge Check -> Additional Resources
```

We're not focused on **scoring you** but instead on providing you the best learning environment for you to grow in the web3 space. The knowledge check section will have a link to where the answer is in the lesson [(inspired by TOP)](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/templates/lesson-example.md).

Try not to skip lessons unless you truly understand the material already, else this should be pretty fun <span>:)</span>

FYI feel free to join the community either on discord or telegram to chat with like-minded folks.

### What's Next

In the upcoming lessons under fundamentals, we'll understand what blockchain, web3, and crypto are. This way it can help prepare you for an upcoming role, hobby project, or to get you into the web3 field. We'll go over different blockchains and learn how a blockchain is able to operate without the need of a central authority.

Atlast, once you reach the end of the fundamentals course, you will be given resources to help with job hunting, such as how to get your first gig to growing your twitter precense. (Though do not worry about this for now as learning the fundamentals is how you'll be getting your first gig, or atleast make it easier).
