# How this Course Will Work

### Introduction

BrainEater.io is an online curriculum focused on teaching you blockchain, Web3, and crypto. Understanding the fundamentals of blockchain is a great way to start working in the crypto industry. Whether you're trying to join or in the process of joining a Web3 company, this is the right place for you.

Before we begin, I want to note that this guide has been heavily inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), TOP is an open-source curriculum that helps guide people on their web dev career (and it's actually how I started my web dev journey). Everything is free, and it'll guide you A-Z on the fundamentals of web dev, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github, and Git + more. 

Another shoutout is to [CollegeDAO](https://collegedao.io/); it's a student-led organization that started at the University of Michigan and has expanded to over 150+ schools around the globe. Many blockchain clubs, such as Berkeley Blockchain, Vanderbilt, UPenn, KU, Purdue, Dalhousie, Columbia... the list goes on that are in partnership with CollegeDao. Their mission is to gather [university blockchain clubs](https://collegedao.io/ecosystem) from all over the world, connect them with each other & allow clubs to participate in the ecosystem: providing guest speakers, validators, governance, job opportunities, etc. **And lastly, thank you to everyone that is reading this, wishing you the best, and I hope you enjoy this guide!**

Here are a couple of terms used throughout this website that we should know, using the website URL as an example:

- Curriculum = the entirety of this website/guide; ex: **BrainEater.io** is the curriculum.
- Course = the path taken, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/**foundation** is the course.
- Lesson = the single pages in each course, ex: BrainEater.io/paths/foundation/**how-this-course-will-work** is the lesson.

For the lesson today, we'll learn the general structure of this curriculum and a couple of pointers to know about. And in the upcoming lessons, we'll go over what Web3 is, the motivation for learning Web3, and other guides to help prepare you for this journey.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of the topics that you will learn in this lesson.

 - Understand how this curriculum works.
 - Understand the foundation course.

Let's get into it!

### How it Works

Each lesson under this curriculum will consist of a general write-up on the topic, reading materials and videos, and sometimes hands-on learning to get a better grasp on how something works. The goal is to prepare you with the basic knowledge of whatever topic that you're on so when you do work on the assignments, you'll have a better understanding of what the material is trying to teach. Again, whether you're completely new to blockchain or just someone that just wants a refresher on certain topics, this guide is made for you, as we'll take into account different learning methods. _Beginner-friendly_

Every lesson will be structured pretty much the same: 
```python 
Introduction -> Basic Knowledge -> Conclusion -> 
Assignment -> Knowledge Check -> Additional Resources
```

We're not focused on **scoring you** but instead on providing you with the best learning environment for you to grow in the Web3 space. The knowledge check section will have a link to where the answer is in the lesson [(inspired by TOP)](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/templates/lesson-example.md).

Try not to skip lessons unless you truly understand the material already; otherwise, this should be pretty fun <span>:)</span>

FYI, feel free to join the community either on Discord or Telegram to chat with like-minded folks.

### What's Next?

In the upcoming lessons under fundamentals, we'll understand what blockchain, Web3, and crypto are. This way it can help prepare you for an upcoming role or hobby, or get you into the Web3 field. We'll go over different blockchains and learn how a blockchain is able to operate without the need for a central authority.

At last, once you reach the end of the fundamentals course, you will be given resources to help with job hunting, such as how to get your first gig to grow your Twitter presence. (Though do not worry about this for now, as learning the fundamentals is how you'll be getting your first gig, or at least make it easier.)
