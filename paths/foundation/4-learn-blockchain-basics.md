# Blockchain 101: Blockchain Fundamentals

### Introduction

If you‚Äôve ever heard words like *blockchain*, *Bitcoin*, or *NFTs* pop up in online convos or on the news ‚Äî and instantly felt overwhelmed ‚Äî this lesson is for you ü´µ. The good news is: you don‚Äôt need to be an expert to understand the basics or even start using blockchain tech. This lesson gives you the **foundational understanding** of what a blockchain is, why it‚Äôs unique, and how blocks actually get added to a chain (spoiler: it‚Äôs not duct tape).

We‚Äôll also demystify terms like *miners*, *validators*, *gas fees*, and *native tokens*. If it sounds complex now, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî by the end, you‚Äôll be fluent enough to explain it to your friends (or your dog).

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover:

- What is a blockchain, really?
- Why blockchains are different from normal databases
- How blocks get added (aka consensus mechanisms)
- Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake
- What are gas fees?
- Native tokens like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX

Let‚Äôs get into it üëá

### What is a Blockchain?

At its core, a **blockchain** is a digital chain of blocks that store data ‚Äî usually transactions. Every block contains a group of transactions like transfers, swaps, lending, etc. Once a block is full, it‚Äôs sealed and linked to the previous block ‚Äî creating a chain üì¶‚û°üì¶‚û°üì¶.

Imagine person A has $1000 and sends $100 to person B. That transaction is bundled into a block, along with others, and then added to the chain. At Block 1: A has $900, B has $100. If A sends another $100 in Block 2, A has $800 and B has $200.

Each new block = a new historical record. So blockchain = public ledger üìú, similar to a bank statement that *everyone can see*.

**Genesis Block**: The very first block in any blockchain. Think of it like the first ever entry in the global ledger.

### Why is Blockchain Special?

Two words: **Decentralization** and **Transparency**.

- **Decentralized**: There‚Äôs no single computer or company controlling the blockchain. Instead, it's distributed across a bunch of servers (called nodes) worldwide. If one goes down? The system still works üß†üåê.
- **Transparent**: Anyone can view the full transaction history. Seriously ‚Äî you can download the entire Ethereum blockchain if you want. No secrets.

This combo means:
- Anyone can verify past transactions
- It‚Äôs super hard (basically impossible) to tamper with old records
- It builds trust without needing a middleman

Use case: A musician can sell music directly to fans *without* Spotify or Apple Music taking a cut.

Financial example: Imagine trading crypto and then the trade *disappears* the next day. Nightmare üòµ. Blockchain ensures trades are permanent and verifiable ‚Äî perfect for DeFi and investing.

### How are Blocks Added?

Before new transactions become part of the blockchain, the network has to agree they‚Äôre legit. This is called **consensus**, and there are two main ways to do it:

#### Proof of Work (PoW)

- Computers (called miners) compete to solve a complex math problem üß†üíª
- First to solve it gets to add the block + earn rewards
- Very secure, but super energy-hungry

> Examples: Bitcoin, early Ethereum

#### Proof of Stake (PoS)

- Validators are chosen to add blocks based on how much crypto they‚Äôve staked (locked up)
- They vote and reach consensus without wasting energy
- Faster, cheaper, and more eco-friendly üå±

> Examples: Ethereum (post-merge), Polygon, Avalanche

### What are Miners, Validators, and Nodes?

| Term       | Role in the Blockchain             |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **Miner**  | Adds blocks using Proof of Work    |
| **Validator** | Adds blocks using Proof of Stake  |
| **Node**   | Stores and broadcasts blockchain data (read-only) |

Miners/validators = active participants adding to the blockchain.  
Nodes = passive participants holding data.

### Gas Fees and Native Tokens

When you interact with a blockchain (send crypto, mint an NFT, etc), you pay a **gas fee**.

Think of it like tipping the network to include your transaction sooner.

- Higher fee = faster inclusion
- Lower fee = maybe you wait a few blocks ‚è≥

These fees are paid in the blockchain‚Äôs **native token**:

| Blockchain | Native Token |
|------------|--------------|
| Ethereum   | ETH          |
| Polygon    | MATIC        |
| Avalanche  | AVAX         |
| BSC        | BNB          |

Blockchains with PoS tend to be cheaper and faster than PoW. That‚Äôs why Polygon transactions cost less than a penny, while Ethereum might cost a few bucks (or a few hundred if you‚Äôre minting NFTs during a bull market üò¨).
