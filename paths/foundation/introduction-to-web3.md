# Introduction to Web3

### Introduction

Welcome to the world of Web3! This course is designed to take you from zero to understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized applications. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone looking to solidify their understanding, this course will provide you with the essential knowledge needed to navigate the Web3 space.

### Lesson Overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

- What is Web3 and why does it matter?
- Understanding the evolution of the web (Web1, Web2, Web3)
- Key concepts and terminology used in the field
- Finally, real-world applications and use cases

### What is Web3?

Web3 is hypothesized to be the next evolution of the internet. It allows applications and services to be built on decentralized networks, primarily known as, blockchain. It started with Web1, an online platform where there were read only websites & every page were static (1990-early 2000s). Then Web2 came along in early 2000s where they introduced more of a social internet. Now websites allowed people to interact and post their own content for everyone to see, for example, Youtube, Reddit, Wikipedia. Now Web3 (2014-2025) is hypothesized to be the next stage of the internet. It allows users on the web to interact with the internet without exposing their privacy & data, and much more! Example: Use the internet without a company tracking every footstep of yours (or if it does, it would reject the company to know who you are, i.e linking the data to you).

A mouthful of information but that's essentially TLDR + a birdseye view of the internet! We'll go deeper into certain topics later in the writing & course. Let's break down the evolution of the internet in a more aestethic way.

Note: Web3 is usually paired with terminologies/topics such as blockchain, crypto, and Bitcoin. (Web3 is the umbrella for it all!)

### The Evolution of the Web

1. **Web1 (1990s - early 2000s)**
   - Static web pages
   - Read-only content
   - Basic HTML websites
   - Limited user interaction

2. **Web2 (2000s - present)**
   - Interactive web applications
   - Social media platforms
   - Cloud computing
   - Centralized services
   - User-generated content

3. **Web3 (emerging)**
   - Decentralized applications (dApps)
   - Blockchain technology
   - Smart contracts
   - Digital ownership
   - Tokenized economies


Web3s purpose to allow people to earn money without the need of trusting companies for payments or the need of companies. It's a way to allow every user support each other.

### Problems within each Web era

Web1 was great but it contaiened flaws such as 
Web2 is dominated by centralized platforms such as: Meta, Amazon, Apple, Google, and etc. This usually means the corporation itself has the control of user privacy and . Web3 gives the users users more control over their data and digital assets.

### Why Web3 Matters

Web3 is important because it:
- Gives users control over their data
- Enables new economic models
- Creates opportunities for financial inclusion
- Reduces reliance on intermediaries
- Opens up new possibilities for digital ownership
