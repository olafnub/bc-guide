# Sending & Receiving Crypto, aka Transactions

### Introduction

We‚Äôve covered wallets, tokens, and smart contracts ‚Äî now comes the part everyone‚Äôs been waiting for: **how do I actually use the blockchain?**

This lesson is all about **transactions**: sending and receiving crypto, paying gas fees, interacting with dApps, and even checking your transaction history. By the end, you‚Äôll be ready to move money like a web3 native üß†üí∏

### On-Ramps and Off-Ramps

Before doing anything on-chain, you need crypto in your wallet. Enter: **on-ramps** (buying into crypto) and **off-ramps** (selling back to fiat).

Two main methods:

#### Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)
- Buy/sell crypto with fiat (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Examples: **Coinbase**, **Binance**
- Can use cards, bank accounts, or P2P payment systems

#### Payment Providers
- Platforms like **MoonPay** let you buy crypto with a credit card
- Integrated in dApps like OpenSea and BeatNami for easy checkout

### Sending & Receiving Crypto

This is the bread and butter of blockchain usage.

#### Sending
- You‚Äôll need the **recipient‚Äôs public key** (wallet address)
- Use your wallet‚Äôs "Send" feature (e.g. MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
- Choose the right **network** (ERC-20 = Ethereum, BEP-20 = BNB, etc.)

#### Receiving
- Share **your public key** with the sender
- The sender handles network settings

‚ö†Ô∏è Double check the network! Sending tokens on the wrong chain can result in permanent loss.

---

### Gas Fees Refresher

Every transaction on-chain requires gas fees (paid in the **native token** of the chain).

- **Simple transfers** usually cost just a few cents (on fast chains)
- **Complex transactions** (like minting NFTs or interacting with DeFi) can get expensive

Gas fees are what power validators or miners to add your transaction to the blockchain.

### Interacting with Smart Contracts

Beyond sending money, most blockchain interactions happen through **dApps** (decentralized apps).

You‚Äôre not just sending money to an address ‚Äî you‚Äôre **calling a function** on a smart contract:

- **Deposit** ‚Üí `deposit()` function
- **Withdraw** ‚Üí `withdraw()` or `withdrawAll()`

#### Two Ways You Earn Interest

1. **Auto-compounding**: Interest is automatically added to your deposit.
2. **Manual claiming**: You have to click ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù ‚Äî and pay gas ‚Äî to receive interest.

Most dApps handle this via buttons on their site. Click ‚Üí sign ‚Üí done ‚úÖ

### Block Explorers üîé

Block explorers are your window into the blockchain.

- Check if your transaction succeeded
- See wallet balances and token holdings
- Export history to Google Sheets/Excel

Popular block explorers:
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
- [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/)
- [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/)

Try pasting your wallet address into one and explore!

### Validation Time

Transactions aren‚Äôt instant ‚Äî they need time to be **confirmed**.

- **Bitcoin Lightning**: ~1 sec
- **Ethereum**: ~15 sec/block (6 blocks = confirmed)
- **Polygon/Solana**: seconds to near-instant

Some chains support **single-block finality**, meaning your transaction is confirmed as soon as it‚Äôs in the block. üß†‚ö°
